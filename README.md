# EarchSandwich

An earth sandwich is made when two people put pieces of bread on the ground at exactly opposite points on the earth’s surface. The technical term for an opposite point on earth is called an “antipole”.

## Features

- [x] Allows someone to type in a three word address then show the three word address for the exact opposite place on the planet.
- [x] Each lookup should be recorded in a history list so that the user can access previously entered addresses. This list should persist after the app is shut down and restarted.

## Requirements

- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0

## Get started

1. Open Configs.swift
